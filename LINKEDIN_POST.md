LinkedIn post: Introducing download-manager

I'm excited to announce the public release of "download-manager" — a lightweight, segment-based download utility written in Node.js.

Why this project
- Reliable, resumable downloads for large files.
- Segmenting and metadata tracking to enable interruption recovery.
- Simple CLI interface and configurable defaults for automation.

Try it out
