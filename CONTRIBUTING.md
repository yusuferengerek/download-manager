# Contributing to download-manager

Thank you for your interest in contributing. We welcome bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and code contributions.

How to contribute

1. Fork the repository and create a topic branch from `main` for your change.
2. Make small, focused commits. Use clear commit messages that explain the why.
3. Run any existing test or lint scripts locally and ensure your changes do not break existing behavior.
4. Open a pull request describing the change, the motivation, and any important implementation details.

Issue guidelines

- Search existing issues before filing a new one.
- Provide steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and environment details (OS, Node.js version).

Pull request checklist

- [ ] The PR targets `main` (or the current default branch) and uses a descriptive branch name.
- [ ] Tests and linters pass locally.
- [ ] Documentation updated when applicable (README, inline comments).
- [ ] Small, focused changes with clear explanations.

Coding style

- Use ES modules and modern JavaScript (async/await, const/let).
- Keep functions small and testable.
- Avoid large refactors in a single PR — break work into reviewable steps.
